## Installation
Copy this repo and load it up using a code editor like Visual Studio Code. You will need Node.js installed to use this, as well as your own Inquirer version 8.2.4 due to the files being ignored by the gitignore file.

## Usage
Begin by navigating to the terminal and going to the Develop folder or wherever you stored the main contents. Then access the generator by typing "node index.js" and going through the prompts as instructed. 

A demo of the generator can be viewed using [this link!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5FZoOY_OWk3nz3o8QYX2oiNyeGKT3oB/view?usp=sharing)
